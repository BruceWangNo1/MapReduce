## MapReduce implementation of distributed systems in Golang
This project is inspired by the MIT course [6.824: Distributed Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/index.html) and most of the code is from the course lab assignment. I am getting familiar with the original code and the current reimplementation is sequential. More work to be continued.

TODO: Sequential Many
## Usage
```
go test -run SequentialMany
go test -run Sequential
```
